 * This routine just adds new RNG's onto the GSL types list.
 * Apparently this is all that is needed -- they subsequently
 * just "work" in the gsl call format.  Note that there DOES
 * have to be a subroutine set with its own state and so forth just
 * like the one in dev_random.c (for the linus entropy generator).
 *
 * From gsl types.c -- N apparently a hard-coded value.  This means
 * that we cannot CURRENTLY go over 100 generators without e.g.
 * increasing N in the gsl sources.  They do leave some room for
 * new ones, but not a lot.  Fortunately, I probably won't ever
 * fill N myself personally...
