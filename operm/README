This is a fake README.  If it were a real README, it would probably
do something useful like tell you how to use this project template
to create a fabulous project.  However, most of its real documentation
of this sort is in the project.abs file, which is in html but alas lacks
the <html> headers (it is designed to be embedded in a php document with
an include).  Sorry.

Still, now that you're reading this you should probably go ahead and
edit it for YOUR personal project, but not in the original project
template directory.  First read project.abs, then follow its
instructions and run "newproject" etc.

This template ASSUMES (possibly wrongly) that you know how to code, are
at least moderately familiar with Make (you can learn a lot looking at
the Makefile), familiar with rpm, with tar, with gzip, with gcc, with
how man pages work.  This might not be true.  If it isn't, don't panic.
Try to follow the (then regrettably sparse) instructions for one in your
state and see if you can get a new project started so it will at least
build and run.  If it does, you're off to the races -- get some books,
read, learn, make the new project just a bit more complicated at a time
and you'll be programming in no time...
