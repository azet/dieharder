Subject: Comments on dieharder concerning minimum and maximum gaps

(1) Comments about Minimum Spacings and 3D-spheres tests in Dieharder

I was playing around with the minimum spacing problems in d dimensions.
When placing N points in a d-dimensional unit torus, the probability
that the minimum distance is less than x is

   1 - exp(-V[d] x^d N^2/2)

where V[d] is the volume factor for a d-dimensional sphere

   V[d] = pi^(d/2)/Gamma(d/2+1)

(thus V[3] = 4 pi/3).

This result holds for

   x^d N << 1 (so that N spheres of radius x are "dilute")
   N >> 1     (to pass into the asymptotic limit)

The proof of this is relatively straightforward (and I'm happy to
forward it to you), but I haven't seen the result quoted in this form
before.  Are you familiar with this result?

This allows the magic constants that appear in Marsaglia's description
of these tests to be replaced by analytic expressions.  In particular
the constant 0.995 for the minimum distance test becomes

    25/(8 pi) = 0.9947...

Likewise, the 120 pi/3 = 125.66, he gives in the description of the
3d-spheres test becomes 125 (and similarly the 30 becomes 375/(4 pi) =
29.84)

This would also let you generalize these tests to vary the dimensions or
the number of points.  (Of course my results are asymptotic, and its
possible that Marsaglia's constants are a better approximation for the
particular N values that he uses.  However, for N = 4000 in the
3d-spheres test, my result should be closer than his.)

Incidentally, the result for d = 1 can be given exactly (arbitrary N on
a circle of circumference 1)

   1 - (1 - N x)^(N-1) for x <= 1/N

This can be derived from the problem of covering a circle by arcs.  See

   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircleCoveringbyArcs.html

(2) Suggest adding a "maximum gap" test

The circle covering problem also yields an exact result for the maximum
gap when N points are randomly placed on a circle.  Perhaps this would
be a good test to add to dieharder.  This has been implemented by Joel
Heinrich of the Univ. of Pennsylvania.  See:

   http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/publications/cdf6850_badrand.pdf

(3) Regards to Henry Greenside.

Next time you see Henry, please give him and Noel my regards.  We were
colleagues together at PPPL.

Thanks for your attention...
