Hello Professor Brown,

Thank you for developing the die-hard suite further.
I have downloaded your code and look forward to using it.

In looking through the original die-hard code I noticed that the overlapping sums test seems to be mathematically incorrect (in your distribution this is file libdieharder/diehard_sums.c.

The argument assumes that the sums S(j) are jointly normal (otherwise it is unclear how a linear transformation will transform them to independent
standard normals).

It is easy to see that there cannot be an invertible linear transformation T transforming the S(j) to independent standard normals Z(j). The existence of such T implies that the S(j) are jointly normal. For this we only have to note that independent standard normals are also jointly normal, apply the inverse linear transformation T^{-1} to the Z(j) and recall that any linear image of the multinormal vector Z is again multinormal.

But it is clear that the S(j) are not jointly normal since for example
S(2)-S(1) = U(101)-U(1) is not normal. 

I noticed in your comments that you are already discouraging the use of this test. Maybe it should be removed altogether.

Sincerely yours,

Michael J. Meyer
