Subject: DieHarder: First results and comments from Centro Vito Volterra

Dear Dr. Brown,

we successfully installed Dieharder with our RNG plugged in and got our
first results. They are, in fact, quite similar to the ones of the
MT19937_1999 as reported in your White Paper.

Now some comments:


1. Bit Distribution Test:
-------------------------

To us it seems a bit odd that this test flunks the "presumably good"
generators gfsr4, MT19937_1999, taus2 as well as our RNG, every one of
them on the 6-bit version with virtually all p-values falling into the
leftmost bin.


2. Bit Stream Test:
-------------------

Our RNG did as poor as gfsr4, MT19937_1999 and taus2.

Possible explanation: Overlapping (as in the original DieHard) means that
the resulting words are not independent. So, in general, the distribution
will be different in the non-overlapping (independent) case. Has this been
considered in your version of the test?

But, strange enough, rerunning the test with the overlapping option didn't
change the results. So I don't know what's happening here.


3. Birthday Spacings Test:
--------------------------

You were wondering why this test is failed as soon as sample size exceedes
around 300. As n -> infinity, the number of duplicate birthday spacings is
APPROXIMATELY Poisson with mean lambda = m^3 / (4n), where m is the number
of birthdays and n is the length of the year. Now if n isn't large enough
there will be a deviation from the limit distribution even with a perfect
RNG. But a goodness-of-fit test based on 100 values may not detect this
while one with 300 does. If the sample size is increased, so must be n.

As described in the Marsaglia/Tsang (2002) paper they are using sample
size 5000, m=2^12, n=2^32 and therefore lambda = 4 for the new version of
the bday test.


4. Overlapping 5-Permutation Test:
----------------------------------

Our RNG fails with the same kind of bath-tub-shaped p-value histogramm as
gfsr4, MT19937_1999 and taus2. Why? I don't know, yet.


5. Question:
------------

Is the generator ever reseeded during a test run? Or just once on
creation?


So much for our first report. We hope that this will also be of help to
your project. We've also noticed that you've been adding new tests to the
package.
So we have also updated our version.

How come the new source code versions include a huge (some 40 MB) binary
mt19937_1999 file?


Best regards,
Markus Gäbler
