Subject: Dieharder: missing code in diehard_sums_test

I see that the Diehard Sums Test is fairly consistently reporting
failures on mt19937 (with -p 1000)

I took a look at Marsaglia's fortran (cdosum).  After he transforms his
x[i] with erfc, he then transforms it again through a linear
interpolation given by the array f.  This is a nearly straight line and
I conjecture that it accounts for the fact that the sum of a 100 uniform
deviates isn't exactly normal.

I don't see you doing the f-correction in diehard_sums.c.  And this
might lead to false positives.
