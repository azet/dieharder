Subject: dieharder: SEGFAULT in file_input_raw_set

Hi Robert.
I'm using dieharder 2.28.1 on FreeBSD 8.0-CURRENT as of this week. The
test suite really useful for the tests of my hardware noise source.
The malloc debugger is also activated on this FreeBSD development
version. It initializes allocated memory bytes with the value 0xa5.
Unfortunately, I run into a SEGFAULT with dieharder -a -g 201 -f
rndtest (rndtest contains some random values of my homebrew hardware
RNG).
An analysis with gdb leads to this: vstate, which goes into
file_input_raw_set in
dieharder-2.28.1/libdieharder/rng_file_input_raw.c is used
unititialized because state->fp has the magical value 0xa5a5a5a5.
So I propose to initialize state->fp in the "if(first) { ... }" block
of file_input_raw_set -- as in the attached patch. This solves the
problem.
I hope that it is not a compiler issue, but if I remember correctly,
this special input method is broken for a long time on FreeBSD.

Could you please have a look at it?

Regards,

Lucius

Should be fixed as of 10/19/09.  Doesn't seem to be a problem on linux
boxes, so it won't be easy to tell until I write him and ask him to test
the fix.
