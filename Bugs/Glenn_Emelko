Subject: Dieharder test suite results and a few bug reports

Dear Dr. Brown,
 
We've been running the "dieharder suite" against our random number generator
hardware, which is entirely contained within a single programmable logic
device.  We felt good when we got through ENT, diehard and the NIST suite,
however after submitting a sample to CACert (search for cacert and random and
look for the 384MB sample that we submitted... it is at the end of the list) I
then wrote to Philipp Guehring to ask for suggestions, and he pointed me in your
direction.  We're getting some very good results, however in the process we've
found a few cosmetic bugs in dieharder that we'd like to report.  I'm also
interested in "next steps" and upon reading your "Development Notes" it occurs
to me that you might wish to validate what we've been able to accomplish in
fairly short order.  We're developing our RNG for commercial purposes, however
considering the complexity of this problem, I would hate to try to do it in a
vacuum.
 
Bug reports:
 
(severity: cosmetic)
The value of filecount for raw input files, when displayed, is truncated to 32
bits and thus does not reflect files containing more than 4294967295 32-bit
integers.  Change %u to %llu in the format string in output.c, results.c, and
test.c.
 
(severity: cosmetic)
The value of filetype is not set when choosing raw input files.  Either
pre-initialize it to 'd' or add an assignment in rng_file_input_raw.c at the top
of the the function file_input_raw_set().
 
(severity: suggestion)
Add a command line option to output the value of "ntuples" to the report (or
always add it).  We found it useful when interpreting results when the number of
times the file was rewound gets large (thus potentially causing patterns in the
data which do not really exist).  If you look at the output that we included,
you will find an added line with this information.
 
(severity: fatal, but may not be a dieharder error)
When using a file larger than 17.2GB we're consistently getting the following
error (which we have not yet traced down... it comes from rgb_file_input_raw.c
on line 55, but that should be just reading the next 32-bit integer in the
file).  Perhaps it is failing because we're using a remotely mounted filesystem,
but it doesn't seem to make sense.
    # file_input_raw(): Error.  This cannot happen.
 
Please feel free to contact me at any time.
 
Best regards,
Glenn

Dr. Brown,

Did you get a chance to look over our RNG results?  It seems to pass your "experimental tests" (which at least in your documentation you had expressed interest in RNG's that do).  I can give you lots of GB worth of data, if you're interested (we'll probably have to put them on a thumb drive or external hard drive).    And yes, please do send a link to the beta test suite - I'd love to run our generator against it!

Regards,
Glenn

Thanks, I'm actually working on dieharder over the next few days so I'll try to get to your reports below.  In my latest 3.28.0beta snapshot, I think I fix at least some of this, but I'll check to make sure.  I haven't tested with files as large as those you are using so you may well have revealed some bugs -- I've added a "stdin" interface that lets one easily run dieharder in a pipe fed by an external RNG to avoid the hassles of working with very large files even when the OS nominally supports them.

I'm also working very hard on the final KS or Kuiper test of the distribution of final p-values per test.  It isn't quite consistent, and another user has submitted corrections for the KS test (at least) that may improve this very soon.  The problem is that dieharder runs at very high levels where it is arguably a test of itself, so that there are two ways to "fail" the null hypothesis -- a bad RNG or pushing a possibly good RNG past the point where a test is reliable.  The latter requires very, very accurate ways of assessing test reliability, and that is hard to come by with RNG testing, given only RNGs to test WITH;-)

In this current version, I'm hoping to make dieharder self-validating with one or more "gold standard" rngs, e.g. AES.  If nothing else, it will make it easier to compare results one gets in terms of a final vector of p-values for the various tests for a given test run to the results of a similar run for a gold standard rng.

If you are interested in trying the new beta, I'll send you a link.  It is tarball only at this point, so you'll have to build it from scratch (which should be easy enough on a gnu system, but may take a bit of programming expertise if you encounter problems).  It has a much nicer, completely user controllable output format that e.g. has ntuple as a controllable (default present) option, and runs sts_serial on a whole range of ntuple values.

Dr. Brown,

I have a little more information on the "This cannot happen" bug - the feof() function returned 1.  So somehow dieharder attempted to read beyond the end of the file, in the middle of a "RGB Lagged Sum Test" (here is the detail from the output of the run):

It got down to this assessment, then the function call to fread() in rgb_raw_input_file.c (line 54) returned 0, and feof() returned 1 (an error occurred).  The value of ferror() was 0.

I suppose it probably needed to rewind the file but didn't notice that it did until too late.

Thoughts?
