That's sufficient for it to compile and open the file, but there are a small 
number of other changes that need to be made to make it actually work.  I 
won't submit my fix because I've done the minimum kludge necessary to make it 
work for me.  Please consider this a request, though, to make it properly 
largefile compliant.

Also can you make it so that it can open block devices as well as regular 
files.  This is another trivial change.
