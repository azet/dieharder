Subject: get_uint_rand in dieharder

Prof. Brown,

It seems that bl and bu should be declared static uint in the function
get_uint_rand() of bits.c.

An unrelated query: I have found that a number of PRNGs (e.g., cryptographic
hash functions, AES) pass rgb_bitdist even for 11- and 12-tuples (which is
as far as my patience went). Since this doesn't accord with your results
(i.e., no generator passes for n>6), I think there might be some build
issues. Are you aware of anyone who has used dieharder in the
cygwin/x86-32/wnt environment?

Many thanks,
Brian Wong
