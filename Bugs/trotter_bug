Subject: dieharder RPM catch-22

I found when building the dieharder test RPM (2.6.24) on CentOS that compile
would fail, not being able to link/find -ldieharder. I ended up having to
install the pre-build libdieharder to build my own. I was building my own in
the first place to put in a Requires: gsl and BuildRequires: gsl-devel. So
there's two issues that might help build smoother :)
