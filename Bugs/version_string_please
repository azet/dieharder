Subject: Re: DieHarder bug?

this is a service, thank you. remark: now it builds with configure && make
straightforward on my 64-bit-box, even checkinstall works fine. with 2.47.7
this was somehow different, but no real problem because of the src.rpm.

just an idea: maybe you could spend a version string shown with the -h
option or elsewhere:-)

as old C-fan i read your C++ rant - haha! ever tried out an array of
pointers to functions as a class member? this syntax is really braindead.
same for clean pthread-integration.

but shame on me! i have to admit that C++ has it's merits when used with
circumspection. and after 15 years or so, even microsoft ships compilers
with no major drawbacks. at least i have heard rumors in this direction:-)


kind regards, heinz van saanen
