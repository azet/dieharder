Subject: dieharder cosmetics et al

hello robert,

still in active dieharder development?

1) than maybe you want to add the missing -B option to dieharder --help
in the next version.

2) processing from stdin in something like this e.g.

   cat foo_rng | dieharder -g 200 -d 0

shows "seeds" in the textual output. thats a bit unsound to me.


playing around with rng's again i found my new personal speed king for
x86_64. lightning fast, tiny, thread save and a convincing performance
with dieharder. when interested in details, look in the attachment.


kind regards from vienna, heinz van saanen
