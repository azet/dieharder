Subject: another issue building DieHarder

Seems like "make install" is not obeying to configure phase
"--mandir=..." flag - even if I ask installing man pages to $prefix/man
this way, these are still put to $prefix/share/man...

(Am for testing some RNGs - obviously; but would like to eventually
create Slackware package for DieHarder along the way...).

Regards,
Alex
