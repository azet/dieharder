At the suggestion of Linas Vepstas on the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL)
list this GPL'd suite of random number tests will be named "DieHarder".
Using a movie sequel pun for the name is a double tribute to George
Marsaglia, whose "Diehard battery of tests" of random number generators
has enjoyed years of enduring usefulness as a test suite.

The DieHarder suite is more than just the diehard tests cleaned up and
given a pretty GPL'd source face in native C.  Tests from the
Statistical Test Suite (STS) developed by the National Institute for
Standards and Technology (NIST) are being incorporated, as are new tests
developed by rgb.  Where possible or appropriate, all tests that can be
parameterized ("cranked up") to where failure, at least, is unambiguous
are so parameterized and controllable from the command line.

A further design goal is to provide some indication of why a generator
fails a test, where such information can be extracted during the test
process and placed in usable form.  For example, the bit-distribution
tests should (eventually) be able to display the actual histogram for
the different bit ntuplets.

DieHarder is by design extensible.  It is intended to be the "Swiss Army
Knife of random number test suites", or if you prefer, "the last suite
you'll ever ware" for testing random numbers.
