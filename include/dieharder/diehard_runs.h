#                    Diehard Runs Test\n\
#  This is the RUNS test.  It counts runs up, and runs down, \n\
# in a sequence of uniform [0,1) variables, obtained by float-  \n\
# ing the 32-bit integers in the specified file. This example   \n\
# shows how runs are counted:  .123,.357,.789,.425,.224,.416,.95\n\
# contains an up-run of length 3, a down-run of length 2 and an \n\
# up-run of (at least) 2, depending on the next values.  The    \n\
# covariance matrices for the runs-up and runs-down are well    \n\
# known, leading to chisquare tests for quadratic forms in the  \n\
# weak inverses of the covariance matrices.  Runs are counted   \n\
# for sequences of length 10,000.  This is done ten times. Then \n\
# repeated.                                                     \n\

# In Dieharder sequences of length tsamples = 100000 are used by\n\
# default, and 100 p-values thus generated are used in a final\n\
# KS test.\n\
